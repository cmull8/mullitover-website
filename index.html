    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>  
    <p>This is a website that I want to make to put myself out there on the world wide web. A way to get my thoughts out there
      and share what I am doing and thinking. I obviously have a long way to go to make this corner of the internet worth your 
      time and attention, but I will slowly work on it as I go.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Cody Mull. I am an MBA student in my last semester and a currently deployed service member of the Illinois Army
      National Guard. I have served as a 25B (IT Specialist) for the past 6 years and I'm currently a Staff Sergeant. 
      I have been deployed to Ukraine and Jordan serving in the same role.
      I have worked in the past at Rivian as a MES Operations Analyst and at Connor Co. as a Systems Administrator. I went to school 
      at Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois where I earned my BS in Information Systems Development and Analysis in 2022. 
      I also graduated with my MBA from Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville with a specialization in Management 
      Information Systems in 2024.
